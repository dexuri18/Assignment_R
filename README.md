## Description
This repository was created as part of assignment on Big Data Analysis course, which will attempt to analyze a database of rodents to determine the relationship between the weight and length of hindfoot, using R Studio.

## Contents of the repository
This repository consists of:
1. Script R (* .R). It is a raw script written by the authors (Deky and Tono) covering every command used in the analysis.
2. Rmarkdown (* .Rmd). It is a summary of the R analysis performed.
3. Pdf file (* .pdf). It is a knit result of Rmarkdown
4. Readme.md. An explanation of this repository
5. The data folder containing the data files being analyzed.
6. scripts.Rproj. It is the project file for RStudio.

## How to
To replicate the process:
1. Install the RStudio
2. Download all the file/folder on this repository
3. Run the scripts.Rproj that will open in RStudio

## Analysis
Analyzes performed on this repository include:
1. Data completeness
2. Number of samples for each species and genus, also the proportion of sex (female and male) for each category
3. Distribution of weight and hindfoot length for the overall sample and the distribution of the mean (weight) weight and hindfoot length for each species
4. The Weight and Hindfoot Length Relationship Analysis for all complete dataset, and
5. The linear model of weight and hindfoot length of the merriami species
